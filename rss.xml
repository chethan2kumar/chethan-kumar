That’s not pessimistic but it is a fundamental truth of nature.
We are finite. Lifespan is bounded. You are a certain height, weight, colour, intelligent, mentally ill, predisposition to cancer. These vulnerabilities are not flaw of nature. These are conditions for your existence. We are what we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, something absolutely horrible may not be happening to you. There may not be something particularly horrible happening to you at the moment, but there is a high possibility that one of your family member is having a horrible phase. If not now, it is  highly probable sure it will happen in the future. To know this frees you. Life can’t be conducted without suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are playing a card game, you are dealt a hand of cards. Then what do you do? You play the best you can for the hand that you are dealt. That’s all you can do. And that strategy most times may not be a winning one. And that’s ok. Because people don’t always win. sometimes we loose and sometimes we loose painfully, sometimes painfully and unjustly. That’s not the point. The point is you don’t have a better strategy. It is better to take responsibility for the hand you have been dealt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to conduct yourself in the face of suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick up your damn suffering and bear it. TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. Try to reduce the suffering. Stand up so that people can rely on you. Minimise the suffering if you can’t transcend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is your calling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop unnecessary suffering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that the world is always desperately short of people who can clearly think and speak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is more suffering in the world than there should be and you can do something about that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And may be if you live with above principles, when you are 80 you look back at your life and see that there is less suffering in the world because of you and it was worth living your life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Beginnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad

&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view
back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet
Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some wiseman said “All of Humanity’s problem stems from his inability to sit quiet and do nothing”.
But I think, not only problems, some useful things also happen because of this inability. For example, this site got created on one such day where I had absolutely nothing to do. That is not to say this site is useful for everyone;). It was useful for me since I learnt various thngs that I always wanted to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is hosted by github pages. Everyone should try hosting their website using github pages. It is completely free. The web content is generated using gatsby JS. Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. The code repository is maintained in github - One private and one public. The private repo holds the gatsby code that is used to generate the web content. The output of the gatsby code is deployed to github pages repository which is, as of now, public.
The github actions is used for CD/CI. It works amazingly well to automate the build from one github repo and get it deployed on a another repo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ofcourse the domain name is registered using AWS Route 53 service. It costs me USD 12 per year to maintain the domain name. github pages provides you the ability to host your website using your own domain name.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
